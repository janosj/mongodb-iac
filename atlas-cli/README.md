# Atlas CLI

Atlas CLI docs: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/

If you haven't used Atlas before, try `atlas setup`. Otherwise, use `atlas auth login`. That opens an Atlas login screen in a browser, you pass some codes back and forth, and that's how your CLI gets connected to your account. Otherwise, try "atlas config init" to use an API key.

The doc page for `atlas cluster create` is [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/command/atlas-clusters-create/). But that take you down a complex path:
- To create the json config file, see [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/reference/json/cluster-config-file/)
- That points to the Atlas Admin API docs, [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Clusters/operation/createCluster)
- From the Atlas Admin API docs, copy the Request sample, paste the contents into a json file, and adjust as necessary. That request sample ends up being somewhat complex. 

An easier path is to start [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/atlas-cli-create-cluster-from-config-file/) ("Create an Atlas Cluster Using a Configuration File"). I exported the configuration of an existing sandbox cluster and modified it. The required fields are [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Clusters/operation/createCluster).
